3. Add OpenWeather API Key,
  Create a .env file in the root of the project (same level as package.json) and add the following line:    

  -VITE_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here.  

  🔐 Note:
	•	Replace your_openweather_api_key_here with your real key from https://openweathermap.org/api
	•	The variable must start with VITE_ for Vite to detect it
	•	The .env file is already listed in .gitignore and will not be pushed to GitHub
